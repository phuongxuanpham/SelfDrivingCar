    "### Architecture and Training Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use a well-known model that is sucessful in the field of self driving car and then twist model parameters as well as use appropriate image pre-processing and augmentation to the training dataset. The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the NVIDIA model in [this paper](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf). I thought this model might be appropriate because the NVIDIA model is well-documented and not complicated and has been proven its effectiveness in self driving car control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I focused on image pre-processing methods which including: \n",
    "- Crop the sky and steering wheel parts in the image.\n",
    "- Resize the images from 160x320x3 matrix to 60x200x3 matrix, which is the input size of the NVIDIA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that the model contains a dropout layer with keeping probability 0.5 in order to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collected more training data in the track one, track two as well as generate more training data using image augmentation methods (see details in the next part).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road."

    "![title](images/side_1.jpg)\n",
    "![title](images/side_2.jpg)\n",
    "![title](images/side_3.jpg)\n",

    "![title](images/center_1.jpg)\n",
    "![title](images/center_1_flipped.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also recorded the vehicle running around the curves only so that the vehicle would learn how to go around the curves.\n",

    "The simulator captures images from three cameras mounted on the car: a center, right and left camera. That’s because of the issue of recovering from being off-center.\n",

    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
